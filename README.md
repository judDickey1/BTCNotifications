# BTCNotifications
Stores python script used to monitor cryptocurrency prices using API calls and sending webhooks to an IFTTT app on my phone.
The app receives updates every 10 minutes from the monitoring with a price point. After storing 5 updates a notification is pushed to my phone to show price change over the last hour.
If the price moves outside of the threshold declared, send an instant notification to alert possible good buy/sell times
